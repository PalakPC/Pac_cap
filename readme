C program to capture packets and list the number of packets sent to and received from an IP address.

Install libpcap0.8-dev before compiling.

Compilation can be done as follows:
gcc pac_cap.c -o pac_cap -lpcap (lpcap is to include the header file pcap.h)

The program can be run as:
sudo ./pac_cap

On execution, it would run until enter key is pressed. Then it would list the packet details.

Currently, it is unable to handle command line options for time and number of packets. Also, it does not list sent and received packets separately. So, incomplete.
